# System_Extractor

Discription:

for real, Since there is no extractor that worked for me on XDA or i can't understand it so 
I planned to create extractor my self.

It can possibly

 Extract system.new.dat
 Repack system.new.dat
 Unpack system.img
 repack system.img
 Sign ZIP files

Hope you liked my worked.

Usage:

Extract system.new.dat files of ROM's , can be able to easily extract .dat files without need of cmd lines.

Note : Repack works with all ROM's
