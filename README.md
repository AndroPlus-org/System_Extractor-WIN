# System_Extractor

usage:

Used to extract system.new.dat files of ROM's , can be able to easily extract .dat files without need of cmd lines.

Note : Repack does not works with all ROM's due to sah1_check, present in updater-script
or I dont know how is it possible to have a double sha1_check of a single file and both sha1_check are different
